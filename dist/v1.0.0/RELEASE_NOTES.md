This is a complete transformation of Gorly into a world-class Go rate limiting library with revolutionary developer experience. This release prioritizes developer happiness, production readiness, and universal framework compatibility.

## ✨ Revolutionary Features

### 🪄 One-liner Magic
```go
// That's it! Rate limiting in one line:
app.Use(ratelimit.IPLimit("100/hour"))
app.Use(ratelimit.APIKeyLimit("1000/hour")) 
app.Use(ratelimit.UserLimit("500/hour"))
```

### 🌐 Universal Middleware System
Works with **ANY** Go web framework out of the box:
- ✅ Gin, Echo, Fiber, Chi, net/http
- ✅ Auto-detection - no framework-specific code needed
- ✅ `limiter.Middleware()` just works everywhere
