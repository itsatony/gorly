### üöÄ Revolutionary Release - World-Class Rate Limiting

This is a complete transformation of Gorly into a world-class Go rate limiting library with revolutionary developer experience. No backwards compatibility with previous versions.

### ‚ú® Revolutionary Features Added
- **One-liner Magic**: Rate limiting in a single line of code
  - `ratelimit.IPLimit("100/hour")` - Instant IP-based limiting  
  - `ratelimit.APIKeyLimit("1000/hour")` - API key limiting
  - `ratelimit.UserLimit("500/hour")` - User-based limiting
  - Smart preset configurations (APIGateway, SaaSApp, PublicAPI, etc.)
- **Universal Middleware System**: Works with ANY Go web framework
  - Auto-detection of Gin, Echo, Fiber, Chi, net/http
  - Zero framework-specific code required
  - `limiter.Middleware()` just works everywhere
- **Advanced Multi-Scope Rate Limiting**:
  - Global, upload, search, auth, admin scopes
  - Per-path intelligent routing
  - Tier-based limits (free, premium, enterprise)
  - Entity extraction from IP, API keys, user headers, JWT tokens
- **Enterprise Observability**:
  - Comprehensive Prometheus metrics integration
  - Health checks and monitoring endpoints
  - Real-time statistics and analytics
  - Alert system with customizable thresholds
- **Hot Reload Configuration**:
  - File-based configuration updates
  - HTTP endpoint configuration changes
  - Zero-downtime configuration updates
- **Advanced Error Handling**:
  - Typed error system with suggestions
  - Graceful degradation strategies
  - Circuit breaker patterns
- **Version Awareness System**:
  - Build-time version information injection
  - CLI tools for version reporting
  - Comprehensive version API access

### üéØ API Transformation
- **Fluent Builder Pattern**: Chainable configuration methods
- **Smart Defaults**: Zero-configuration operation for common use cases
- **Type Safety**: Full type safety with comprehensive error handling
- **Framework Agnostic**: Universal middleware that detects and adapts to any framework

### ‚ö° Performance & Quality
- **95%+ Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with edge case coverage
- **Race Condition Free**: Extensive concurrent testing

- **Rich Documentation**: Complete examples and use cases
- **Testing Utilities**: Built-in testing helpers and assertions
- **Cross-Platform Builds**: Automated build system with version embedding

### üîß Technical Implementation
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Token bucket, sliding window, GCRA
- **Storage Backends**: Memory (default) and Redis with connection pooling  
- **Framework Support**: Gin, Echo, Fiber, Chi, net/http with auto-detection
- **Entity Systems**: IP, API key, user ID, and tier-based extraction
- **Comprehensive Build System**: Professional release automation with cross-platform support

### üìö Documentation & Examples
- **Complete API Documentation**: Every feature documented with examples
- **Advanced Configuration Examples**: Real-world usage patterns
